# Voice

Voice is an implemented ANUM surface built on the same identity, task, approval, memory, and event boundaries as typed commands.

## Voice Use Cases

- Start and manage tasks hands-free.
- Hear concise task status updates.
- Approve or reject low-friction actions when policy allows.
- Dictate notes and instructions into memory or tasks.
- Use desktop or mobile context while moving between devices.

## Architecture

Voice clients should connect to the same backend task APIs and realtime streams as other clients. Speech-to-text, text-to-speech, and realtime audio models should be provider adapters behind the model gateway when possible.

## Safety

Voice approval requires extra care. The system should confirm high-impact decisions using clear summaries and may require visual confirmation or device authentication for sensitive actions. Voice transcripts should be treated as sensitive memory sources.

## Implemented

- Tenant-scoped voice sessions and configurable session, 30-day, or permanent transcript retention.
- Flutter push-to-talk with device speech recognition, English and Arabic locale selection, partial transcription, stop/cancel, and editable review.
- Explicit command confirmation before task creation and governed execution.
- Visual approval escalation for sensitive actions; spoken approval cannot bypass policy.
- Permission-denied recovery and a keyboard fallback.
- Optional text-to-speech confirmation of the created task status.
- Seven approved Figma screens, a six-state Voice Capture component, and an eight-step voice safety workflow.

## Remaining Release Gates

- Physical Android and iOS microphone, Bluetooth headset, interruption, and background lifecycle testing.
- OIDC release authentication, notification deep links, and device-authenticated approval where policy requires it.
- Provider-backed streaming audio only if short device speech recognition is insufficient; the current implementation is intentionally push-to-talk for concise commands.
